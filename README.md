# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS

This Python-based web application leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Utilizing a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, the app analyzes text input from usersâ€”specifically movie reviewsâ€”to determine whether the sentiment behind each review is positive or negative. The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily input their movie reviews and receive immediate sentiment feedback.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a Data Science in machine learning enthusiast, who is currently pursuing an Msc. in Business Analytics, hoping to graduate in May, 2024. I built this project mainly to help individuals like me who are particular about movie critiques and sometimes find it difficult to understand critics, easily navigate through critic comments.

I also built this project to cement my knowledge on NLP and AI models in general.


## Local Deployment Instructions

This guide will help you get the movie review sentiment analysis web application running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This application is built using Python and Flask, and it leverages the BERT model for sentiment analysis.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Waveeyy/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. To set up a virtual environment, run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate

```

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

```
## Step 3: Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Run the Application
Now that all dependencies are installed, you can start the web application locally:

``` bash
python app.py
```
